        <h2 class="text">Hi, Thank You for visiting my page!</h2>
        <h3 class="text">I work in Software and I wanted to build my own page using the bare bones of the web, HTML and CSS. So here it is, a site about me on the web!</h3>
        <br />
        <h4>I became a software professional by accident. I had done my Engineering in Telecom, I had no idea that campus recruitments in India are predominantly IT jobs. This is true for most Engineers from tier 2 colleges.</h4>
        <h4>I am glad that now I can feel Computer Science, putting it philosophically. During Covid, I chanced upon MKBHD videos and Steve Jobs biography. My perspective towards tech changed, my horizons broadened and that is why I say I can feel Computer Science!</h4>
        <br />
        <h4>I have watched too much Tennis in my teens and twenties. And like any Tennis fan, I am fascinated by the big 3 of Tennis; Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic. I am a Rafan but honestly I love all the 3.</h4>
        <h4>I love watching movies, shows and also reading books. My favorite are The Dark Knight, The Bear, Jab We Met and there are so many more. My favorite books include The Forty Rules Of Love, Anxious People, the Steve Jobs biography, and there are so many more!</h4>
        <br />
        <h4>I like travelling. It challenges me. I haven't been outside India yet but its a dream to visit both the US and European countries. In India, I have been to Goa, Amritsar, Delhi, Uttarakhand, and I am yet to explore so many other places.</h4>
        <h4>I believe Internet is the greatest invention so far. YouTube is my favorite place on the net. The next greatest invention could be something to tackle the climate change issues, hope so! You can find me on <a href="https://x.com/jatin_sw" target="_blank">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jatin-wadhwani-18596110b/" target="_blank" >LinkedIn</a> too. Peace..</h4>
